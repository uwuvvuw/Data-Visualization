# Data-Visualization

Data Visualization is a presentation of data in pictorial or graphical format. The reasons behind why we visualize is because we want to explore the unknown, analyze a hypotheses and present "everything" known about the data, and communicate the results. In this jupyter notebook, matplotlib is mainly used as it is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific figures.
